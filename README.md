heroku log analyzer

Depends on:

* Heroku toolbelt.
* GNU/Timeout - on OSX do ``brew install coreutils``. Linux should have it.
* Run bundle install in it's directory and it will grab the gems that it requires
* Tested on OSX with Ruby 1.9.3
* This should work on linux, however it's not been tested yet
